# nk-mvc

The 'Hello World!' example of a nodakwaeri MVC Application.


##Installation

To get started, open terminal/shell/command prompt and browse to the root of your application.  Clone the nk-mvc repository:

```
path_to_application/> git clone git@github.com/mmod/nk-mvc.git
```

When finished we need to install the dependencies.  Unless I'm wrong:

```
path_to_application/> npm install .
```

Should do the trick, but in case it doesn't:

```
path_to_application/> npm install nk;
path_to_application/> npm install nodamysql;
```

## Usage

At this time, all examples can be found within the app/ directory of the source.  


## Development

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.  As the framework develops we will move on to a CMS/XRM system built upon the MVC framework.
